## ðŸ’» About 

 The Food Order application is a React.js project developed with the purpose of practicing front-end development using the framework and the use of the **Redux** library. The main goal of the application is to simulate a food order application, like iFood ou Uber Eats, where you can check a list of available foods, add the ones you wish to the cart and go through a simple checkout process. The app is using Firebase as a dumb Rest API, to be able to fetch available meals and store cart data.
